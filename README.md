# task_5_desicionTree

## 📌 Objective
Build and evaluate tree-based models for classification tasks using a user-uploaded dataset (e.g., Heart Disease dataset).

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Google Colab
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (DecisionTree, RandomForest, metrics, cross_val_score)

## 📁 Dataset
Works with any classification dataset. Detects a suitable target column automatically (modify if needed).

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Upload the dataset (.csv)
2. Encode target and categorical features
3. Normalize numerical features
4. Train a Decision Tree (with depth control)
5. Train a Random Forest
6. Visualize:
   - Decision tree structure
   - Feature importance bar plot
7. Evaluate:
   - Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
   - 5-fold cross-validation

## 📈 Output
- Tree diagram
- Random forest feature importances
- Cross-validation results
- Classification performance metrics
